# Movie-genre-prediction-using-machine-learning
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. The project involves preprocessing the text data and applying classifiers to create a robust genre prediction model.

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to classify movie genres based on their plot summaries. We preprocess the text data using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) to convert the plot summaries into numerical features. After preprocessing, we apply classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train the model and predict the movie genres.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres. The data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any noise and irrelevant information. You can find the dataset.(link_to_dataset).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
